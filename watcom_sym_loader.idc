//Semi automated Watcom Symbol loader Script
//by tomsons26
//
//The Load DWARF File has a flaw with Watcom ELF's,
//it doesn't account for the base address and loads at 0x0 base
//This automates rebasing it, loading the elf and restoring the base.

//PROBABLY_TODO
//figure out how to scan the input exe for the elf and extract it instead, if no elf do nothing
//Find out if its possible to pass the filename to the RunPlugin function somehow
//Figure out how to do this on startup when the binary is being loaded

#include <idc.idc>

	auto Base, Compiler;

	//Wait for autoanalysis to complete before running the script
